# Calorie
Calorie is a tool using the Taiwanese FDA Database as well as the USDA FDC API to calculate the total amount and calorie per 100g in a recipe.
* Language: Only Traditional Chinese is supported for now
* Add your own food ingredients with their calorie
* Search up an ingredient's calorie count through the Database
* Automatically calculates the total calorie and calorie per 100g
* Calculates total calories through the designated serving size of a recipe <br />

This is my first app, I am still figuring out how to bypass the Microsoft Defender, which is most likely impossible.
# Future Updates
* Hopefully I will abandon the use of the FDC API and use their database directly instead.
